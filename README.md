# COP3330 - Data Structures, Algorithms, and Generic Programming 1 Coursework

These assignments are from my time in COP3330 in Spring of 2022.

I didn't feel that assignments 1 through 4 warranted an upload to this repo, so here are the final 3 assignments from COP3330.

To compile each of them, simply use your favorite C++ IDE or your C++ compiler of choice then type make in a Powershell window and run the associated .exe file.
# Project Summaries

Project 5 - A rudimentary dictionary implementation using CRUD alongside dynamic memory allocation, and composition. The user can add, remove, and update key-value pairs within the dictionary as they see fit.

Project 6 - A shape calculator which allows the user to add shapes to a polymorphic list of objects which inherit from the base class Shape, as well as accessing the list and using polymorphic binding to use the correct definition of each shape's functions. CRUD alongside dynamic memory allocation is also used to resize the list of shapes as needed.

Project 7 - A console based rendition of a popular Japanese RPG with monsters that can fit in your pocket. This was a group effort with two classmates **(thanks Ginny and AJ!)**, in which we used several of the object-oriented principles we learned over the semester. Primarily we made use of CRUD alongside dynamic memory allocation and inheritance.
